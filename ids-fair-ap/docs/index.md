# Welcome to the IDS FAIR Application Profile - IDS-FAIR-AP

!!! warning "Draft Version"
    This application profile is work in progress and subject to change.

The IDS FAIR Application Profile is an extensions to the IDS information model to facilitate the description of FAIR research artifacts. The objective is to provide approachable and precise guidelines how to serve research artifacts with IDS specifications.
In addition, the profile supports the semantic description of the actual data with a strong focus on tabular data.

IDS-FAIR-AP is based on the IDS information model and the following ontologies:


* [Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/)
* [CSV on the Web](https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-data-primer/)
